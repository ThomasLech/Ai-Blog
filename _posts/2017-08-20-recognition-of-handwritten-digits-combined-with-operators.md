In the [previous post][image-processing-for-text-recognition], we processed requested image in order to extract patterns from it. Now, before we predict classes of the extracted patterns, we need to train the classifier.

We'll train the most basic deep learning model: **Neural Network with 1 hidden layer**.

After [patterns were extracted from processed image][image-processing-for-text-recognition], we want to train classifier to predict their classes. In order to do so, we'll train the most basic deep learning model: **Neural Network with 1 hidden layer**.

It's about time to train the classifier. In this post we'll train Neural Networks to classify
